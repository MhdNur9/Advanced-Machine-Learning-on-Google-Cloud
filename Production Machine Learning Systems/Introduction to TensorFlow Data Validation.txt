Learning objectives
You learn how to:

Review TFDV methods.

Generate statistics.

Visualize statistics.

Infer a schema.

Update a schema.

Setup
For each lab, you get a new Google Cloud project and set of resources for a fixed time at no cost.

Sign in to Qwiklabs using an incognito window.

Note the lab's access time (for example, 1:15:00), and make sure you can finish within that time.
There is no pause feature. You can restart if needed, but you have to start at the beginning.

When ready, click Start lab.

Note your lab credentials (Username and Password). You will use them to sign in to the Google Cloud Console.

Click Open Google Console.

Click Use another account and copy/paste credentials for this lab into the prompts.
If you use other credentials, you'll receive errors or incur charges.

Accept the terms and skip the recovery resource page.

Note: Do not click End Lab unless you have finished the lab or want to restart it. This clears your work and removes the project.

Task 1. Set up your environment
Enable the Recommended APIs
In the Google Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu, click Vertex AI.

Click Enable All Recommended API.

Task 2. Launch Vertex AI notebooks
In the Google Cloud Console, on the Navigation Menu, click Vertex AI > Workbench. Select User-Managed Notebooks.

On the Notebook instances page, click Create Notebook.

In the Create instance dialog, confirm the name of the deep learning VM, if you donâ€™t want to change the region and zone, leave it to default.

Click Environment, and select TensorFlow Enterprise 2.6 (with LTS and Intel MKL-DNN/MKL) from the dropdown.

Click Machine type, and select E2 standard > e2-standard-2.

Leave all settings as they are and then click Create. The new VM will take 2-3 minutes to start.

Click Open JupyterLab.
A JupyterLab window will open in a new tab.

Task 3. Clone course repo within your Vertex AI notebooks instance
To clone the training-data-analyst notebook in your JupyterLab instance:

In JupyterLab, to open a new terminal, click the Terminal icon.

At the command-line prompt, run the following command:

git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst
Copied!
To confirm that you have cloned the repository, double-click on the training-data-analyst directory and ensure that you can see its contents.
The files for all the Jupyter notebook-based labs throughout this course are available in this directory.

Task 4. Introduction to TensorFlow data validation
In the notebook interface, navigate to training-data-analyst > courses > machine_learning > deepdive2 > production_ml > labs, and open tfdv_basic_spending.ipynb.

In the notebook interface, click Edit > Clear All Outputs.

Carefully read through the notebook instructions and fill in lines marked with #TODO where you need to complete the code.

Tip: To run the current cell, click the cell and press SHIFT+ENTER. Other cell commands are listed in the notebook UI under Run.

Hints may also be provided for the tasks to guide you along. Highlight the text to read the hints (they are in white text).
If you need more help, look at the complete solution at training-data-analyst > courses > machine_learning > deepdive2 > production_ml > solutions and open tfdv_basic_spending.ipynb.
